The company has tasked you with creating and managing a relational database to streamline student enrollment, course registrations, and faculty assignments for a university. Recently, the university’s administration realized that many processes are handled manually using spreadsheets, which causes errors and data loss. Your project will lay the groundwork for a more robust, accurate, and retrievable system by leveraging PostgreSQL.\n\nProject Objective  \nYour goal is to design, create, and administer a PostgreSQL-based relational database to manage student enrollments, course details, and faculty assignments. You will practice and reinforce database fundamentals by performing all operations in a hands-on lab environment using a pre-configured PostgreSQL instance. This project will involve creating tables, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, importing and modifying sample datasets, performing simple basic administration tasks such as backups and restores, and responding to guided self-assessment questions after each module section.\n\nProject Tasks and Features (to be completed in 2 hours)\n\n1. Hands-On Lab Setup  \n   - Access a hands-on lab environment with a pre-configured PostgreSQL instance.  \n   - Familiarize yourself with the environment’s login process and basic command line tools.\n\n2. Step-by-Step Database Creation and Manipulation  \n   - Follow detailed, scaffolded instructions to:\n     - Create a new database called university_enrollment.\n     - Define and create tables: students, courses, faculty, enrollments, and course_assignments.  \n     - Specify primary keys, foreign keys, and column data types aligning with beginner-level best practices. All scripts and schema definitions are provided as templates.\n\n3. Sample Dataset for Experimentation  \n   - Load provided sample CSV files or SQL inserts for each table:\n     - Students: ID, name, email, date of birth.\n     - Courses: ID, title, credits.\n     - Faculty: ID, name, department.\n     - Enrollments: enrollment_id, student_id, course_id, enrollment_date.\n     - Course_assignments: assignment_id, faculty_id, course_id, assignment_date.\n   - Verify data using SELECT queries.\n\n4. Practice Exercises for CRUD Operations  \n   - Complete practical exercise scripts to:\n     - Add new students, courses, and faculty using INSERT.  \n     - Query enrollment information to find which students are in which courses.\n     - Update student or course information using UPDATE.  \n     - Delete enrollments or courses using DELETE, observing referential integrity constraints.  \n   - Each operation comes with stepwise instructions and example queries.\n\n5. Self-Assessment Questions After Every Module Section  \n   - After finishing each module (database/table creation, data import, CRUD operations), answer a small set of self-assessment questions to verify your comprehension (e.g., \"What command did you use to add a new student?\").\n\n6. Scaffolded SQL Scripts for Guided Learning  \n   - Utilize provided starter SQL script templates for all steps.  \n   - Complete scripts by filling in specified sections throughout the hands-on exercises.\n\n7. Manual and Script-Based Data Backup/Restore Steps  \n   - Perform a basic manual backup of your university_enrollment database using pg_dump, following guided instructions.  \n   - Restore the backup into a new database named university_enrollment_backup using psql.\n\nLearning Outcomes  \nBy the end of this project, you will be able to:\n\n- Gain hands-on experience with PostgreSQL fundamentals by designing and interacting with a real database for educational data.\n- Confidently execute SQL commands for database setup, querying, updates, deletions, and data integrity enforcement.\n- Demonstrate your grasp of basic database administration by performing both script-based and manual backup and restoration procedures.\n- Self-assess and explain your process and reasoning at every stage, reinforcing learning and practical confidence.\n\nTarget Audience Alignment and Assumptions  \nThis project is specifically designed for Beginner database learners: students, junior developers, and those with little or no experience with PostgreSQL. All terminology, sample data, and instructions assume no prior exposure to advanced database concepts or administrative tasks. The language is clear and direct, avoiding jargon beyond the fundamental SQL and PostgreSQL functions taught in introductory curriculum.\n\nTimeline  \n• 0–10 min: Lab environment orientation and database creation  \n• 10–30 min: Table creation with scaffolded scripts  \n• 30–50 min: Sample data import and verification  \n• 50–90 min: Structured practice exercises (CRUD operations, referential integrity)  \n• 90–110 min: Manual/script-based backup and restore procedures  \n• 110–120 min: Complete final self-assessment and submit results\n\nActionable Steps for Project Execution  \n1. Log into your pre-configured PostgreSQL lab environment.\n2. Follow written instructions to create the database and tables.\n3. Use scaffolded scripts to import and manipulate the sample dataset.\n4. Work through guided CRUD exercises with real data.\n5. Periodically answer comprehension and reflection questions embedded in instructions.\n6. Perform and verify database backup/restore procedures as instructed.\n7. Confirm your learning by reviewing self-assessment results.\n8. Submit your completed lab logs as project documentation.\n\nStrict Feature and Learning Outcome Adherence  \nEvery element of the project strictly follows these features:\n\n- Lab environment with pre-configured PostgreSQL instance\n- Step-by-step instructions for database creation and manipulation\n- Practice exercises for CRUD tasks\n- Experimentation with a sample education-related dataset\n- Section-by-section self-assessment questions\n- Scaffolded SQL scripts to guide and reinforce learning\n- Both manual and script-based backup/restore demonstrations\n\nAnd directly leads to:\n\n- Hands-on experience with PostgreSQL fundamentals\n- Confidence using SQL in a real-world context\n- Foundational understanding of core administration tasks\n\nProject Relevance  \nThis project provides practical, resume-ready experience in using PostgreSQL to address real problems in educational data management, ensuring learners not only know what to do, but why and how, all within a focused, scaffolded, and achievable laboratory timeframe.\n\nEnd of Problem Statement."
