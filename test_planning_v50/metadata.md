## Problem Statement
- ### Problem Statement for Backend Development (Python Core): “Hello, World!” Console Application

---

#### Scenario-Based: Real-World Role and Challenge

**Role:**  
You have just been onboarded as a Backend Developer at a newly established tech startup, TechLaunch Solutions, which is dedicated to building modern, scalable backend systems for a range of clients. Your first assignment is a critical one: every developer at TechLaunch must demonstrate their understanding of foundational backend development concepts before moving on to more complex backend systems and services.

**Problem Context:**  
As part of the company's best practices for onboarding, each new backend developer is required to implement a basic but essential backend application—the classic “Hello, World!” application. This application will serve as your gateway to ensuring your development environment is correctly set up, and that you fully understand the essential structure and workflow of Python programs run from the command line. This step mimics real-world processes that ensure technical consistency and readiness before contributing to production systems.

**Objective:**  
Your goal is to write a Python script that, when executed from the command line, displays the message “Hello, World!” to the terminal. This script will help you and your team standardize the initial setup process, verify that Python is correctly installed, and reinforce the coding standards for all backend development activities at TechLaunch. The skills you acquire here will be directly transferable as you progress to more advanced backend logic and data processing tasks.

---

#### Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- **Understand the structure and syntax of a basic Python script**: Learn how Python scripts are structured at a fundamental level, including file naming, content, and syntax requirements.
- **Gain experience running code from the command line**: Execute your Python script using terminal or command prompt tools, simulating everyday backend developer workflows.
- **Familiarize with outputting data to the terminal in Python**: Practice utilizing Python’s built-in output functions to communicate results or status to end users, an essential part of developing any user- or system-oriented backend function.

---

#### Target Audience Alignment

This project is tailored for Python beginners—new developers who may have limited exposure to programming concepts or educators guiding first-time coders. It does not assume prior professional experience, only a willingness to learn and basic computer literacy. All instructions and context will be presented in clear, accessible language with zero requirement for advanced programming concepts.

---

#### Time Constraints

This project is designed to be completed within **15 minutes**, making it a perfect exercise for classroom instruction or self-directed onboarding. The timeline ensures focused engagement:

- 2 minutes: Read and understand the problem statement.
- 5 minutes: Write the Python script.
- 5 minutes: Save and execute the script from the command line.
- 3 minutes: Reflect on what you learned.

---

#### Project Task Breakdown

1. **Write the Script (5 minutes)**
    - Open a plain text editor of your choice (such as VSCode, Atom, Sublime Text, or even Notepad).
    - Create a new file and save it as `hello_world.py`.
    - In this file, write the necessary Python code to display the exact message: `Hello, World!` to the terminal.

2. **Understand Script Structure and Syntax**
    - Ensure your code adheres to Python syntax: statements should be properly written with attention to case-sensitivity and indentation.
    - Example structure (not the exact answer, but for guidance): Use the `print()` function to output your message.

3. **Run Your Script from the Command Line (5 minutes)**
    - Open your computer’s terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
    - Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_world.py`.
    - Execute the script using the command:  
      ```
      python hello_world.py
      ```
    - Confirm that the output is exactly:  
      ```
      Hello, World!
      ```

4. **Reflect on the Task (3 minutes)**
    - Consider what the script does, why it is structured as it is, and what steps were necessary to run it from the command line.
    - If working in a team or classroom, discuss with peers or your instructor how this sets a strong foundation for future backend projects.

---

#### Team-Based Adaptation (If Working as a Group)

- **Roles**: Pair up so that one person writes the script, while the other acts as a “reviewer,” checking for accuracy and adherence to the guidelines. Switch roles if time allows.
- **Collaboration**: Both members should practice running the script and verbalizing how the structure leads to the output.
- **Objective**: Submit your finished script to your instructor or team lead, demonstrating collaborative completion and understanding of the task.

---

#### Feature Set Adherence

The sole focus of this task is to:
- **Display a 'Hello, World!' message to the console**

No additional features or extraneous functionality should be added, ensuring strict alignment with foundational backend development skills.

---

#### Summary: Why This Is Important

By completing this simple yet industry-standard onboarding task, you are setting yourself up for success in all future backend development. You will acquire confidence with basic Python syntax, master executing scripts in a backend workflow, and establish best practices for interacting with users or other systems via command-line interfaces.

**Begin now by opening your editor, and build the fundamental “Hello, World!”—your first step as a backend developer at TechLaunch Solutions!**
