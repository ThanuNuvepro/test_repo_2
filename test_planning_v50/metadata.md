## Problem Statement
- Project Problem Statement: “Hello, World!” Launchpad for New Python Developers

Scenario

Description:
You have just been onboarded as a Junior Python Developer at a general software development company, CodeBright Solutions. As part of your orientation, you are required to get familiarized with the company's development workflow and Python basics. Your first official task is to write, execute, and verify a Python script that outputs the classic “Hello, World!” message to the console. This task serves as an introduction to Python programming, ensuring you can use basic syntax, print statements, and run Python scripts as part of the software development process.

Core Guidelines:

- Real-World Role: You are a Junior Python Developer on your first day at a software company, learning the fundamentals that will be foundational for all your future projects.
- Problem Context: Industry best practices require all incoming developers to demonstrate proficiency in fundamental programming constructs and workflow, starting with the simplest Python script—printing a message to the console. This serves both as an onboarding ritual and a basic technical check.
- Objective: Your mission is to set up your development environment, author a minimal but correct Python script that prints “Hello, World!” to the console, and execute it, demonstrating your understanding of Python core concepts.
- Learning Outcomes: Completing this project target the following skill areas:
    - Understand and apply Basic Python Syntax.
    - Use the print statement to send output to the console.
    - Set up (create and save) and execute a Python script using your chosen IDE or the command line.
- Target Audience Alignment: This task is explicitly designed for beginner developers learning Python. It assumes no prior programming experience beyond basic computer literacy and is paced for Easy-level onboarding. All instructions avoid technical jargon and presume no pre-existing Python setup.
- Time Constraints: This project is designed for completion in no more than 15 minutes, split explicitly into setup, coding, and testing milestones.

Project Task Breakdown

Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment (Estimated time: 5 minutes)
- Download and install Python (version 3.x recommended) if it’s not already available on your machine.
- Choose an editor/IDE you are comfortable with (e.g., IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, or even Notepad).
- Open your chosen editor and create a new file. Save the file as hello_world.py in a dedicated folder.

Step 2: Writing the Python Script (Estimated time: 3 minutes)
- In your new file, use the correct Python syntax to print a message to the console. The script must contain only one output statement displaying exactly:
  Hello, World!
- Example code:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```

Step 3: Executing and Verifying the Script (Estimated time: 4 minutes)
- Open your command line or terminal.
- Navigate to the folder where you saved hello_world.py.
- Execute the script with the command:
  python hello_world.py
- Confirm that the only output displayed in your console is:
  Hello, World!

Step 4: Reflection and Submission (Estimated time: 3 minutes)
- Double-check your code for errors in syntax or casing.
- Ensure your output matches the expected result precisely.
- Prepare a brief note (1-2 sentences) summarizing what you did and submit both your hello_world.py file and your note to your onboarding reviewer or supervisor for feedback.

Project Criteria & Relevance

- The script must use proper Python Basic Syntax (such as correct indentation and case sensitivity).
- You must use a print statement as defined in Python Core.
- The file must be an executable Python script, set up, saved, and run from your local environment (not within a Python interpreter or notebook).
- All instructions and output must adhere strictly to the boundaries of printing “Hello, World!”; no additional logic, text, or features are to be included.

Why This Matters

This project is foundational to your journey as a Python developer. Printing “Hello, World!”:
- Confirms your ability to use Python’s basic syntax
- Divides the workflow into writing, saving, and running code—essential practices for any developer
- Introduces you to the process followed in nearly every industry setting before you move on to more complex tasks

By following the above steps, you have demonstrated initial competency in:
- Basic Python syntax
- Using the print statement
- Setting up and successfully executing a Python script

Make this your launching pad for mastering Python Core and stepping into more advanced programming challenges at CodeBright Solutions—and beyond!
