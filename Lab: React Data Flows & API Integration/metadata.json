The platform's core mission is to empower teachers and students with real-time, actionable data insights to inform teaching and learning strategies. The product team is building a \"Student Progress Dashboard\"—a single-page React application designed to display up-to-date student achievement metrics by fetching data from a public educational API.\n\nRecent trends in educational technology emphasize the value of data-driven instruction. As schools increasingly adopt remote or blended learning environments, teachers need immediate, flexible access to student progress indicators (e.g., quiz scores, attendance records, assignment completions). Your task is to contribute to this mission by building the dashboard’s primary data flow, enabling teachers to see meaningful performance insights and submit updates (such as feedback or attendance marks) directly within the interface.\n\nProject Objective\n\nDevelop a modular, testable React application implementing a \"Student Progress Dashboard\" that showcases dynamic real-world educational data fetched from a public API. Your solution will demonstrate standard React data flow patterns, robust API handling for both data retrieval and submission, responsive UI feedback on loading/error states, and code organization that fosters component reuse and maintainability. Additionally, you will integrate practical unit tests to validate core logic around async data handling and stateful rendering.\n\nProject Requirements (Features)\n\nYour application must:\n\n1. Display dynamic data fetched from a public education-related API (e.g., mock service returning student records, quiz results, assignment submissions).\n2. Use a component-based, stateful UI architecture with clear parent-to-child data flow.\n3. Initiate API calls in response to explicit user actions (e.g., clicking “Load Students”, selecting a class, or viewing detailed progress).\n4. Show clear loading indicators (while data is being fetched) and user-friendly error messages in UI when API calls fail.\n5. Employ prop drilling and/or React Context to pass API-fetched data to deeply nested or sibling components as needed.\n6. Encapsulate data display logic in at least two reusable components (e.g., a StudentList and a StudentDetail or StudentCard component).\n7. Include a simple, controlled input form (e.g., submit quick teacher feedback or mark attendance), handling form state and on-submit API call, with loading/error UI feedback for submissions.\n8. Provide unit test coverage targeting:\n    - Correct display of dynamic data after loading.\n    - Proper handling of loading and error states.\n    - Verification of parent/child data flow and prop/context usage.\n    - Async UI updates in response to API fetches and form submissions.\n    - Rendering logic of reusable components with mock data.\n\nTask Steps and Timeline (3–4 hr lab, Intermediate Level)\n\nAssumptions: You are an intermediate web developer, comfortable with JavaScript ES6, basic React (functional components, hooks, props, state), and know how to run simple tests with a framework such as Jest + React Testing Library.\n\nStep 1 (30–40 min): API Data Fetch & Component Scaffold\n- Research and select a relevant public education data API (or use the provided mock endpoint).\n- Scaffold a new React app, organizing components for dashboard, student list, student details, and a feedback/attendance form.\n- Implement initial API fetch on button click (not on mount), store results in parent state, and pass to child components.\n\nStep 2 (45–60 min): Stateful, Component-Based UI with Data Flow\n- Use state lifting or React Context as appropriate to share student data between sibling/nested components.\n- Create at least two reusable components (e.g., <StudentCard />, <StudentList />) that display dynamic, API-driven content.\n- Ensure data drill-down is possible (select student in list to view details).\n- Employ prop drilling and/or context to facilitate flexible data passing.\n\nStep 3 (40–50 min): User Feedback, Loading, and Error Handling\n- Integrate loading spinners/placeholders while data is being fetched.\n- Gracefully handle errors—display error messages in UI if API fails.\n- Ensure feedback is clear for both fetch and submission flows (form submission).\n\nStep 4 (35–45 min): Data Submission Flow (Form)\n- Implement a simple, controlled React form to submit teacher feedback or attendance for a student.\n- On valid form submission, trigger a POST/PUT request to the mock API.\n- Handle form state, provide loading and error UI feedback, and update dashboard data reactively after submission.\n\nStep 5 (45–55 min): Unit Testing Core Data Flows\n- Write unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library) for:\n    - Successful fetch and display of API data.\n    - User action triggering API fetch.\n    - Loading and error indicator rendering.\n    - Prop/context data flow into reusable components.\n    - Form interaction, submission logic, and UI updates.\n- Use API mocks where needed to simulate async flows.\n\nProject Deliverables\n\n1. README with setup instructions, description, and API endpoint(s) used.\n2. Complete React application meeting all requirements, organized in logical folders/files.\n3. At least five meaningful unit tests with explanations of tested core logic.\n4. Brief technical notes on your data flow architecture (diagram/sketch optional but encouraged).\n\nAssessment Criteria\n\n- Functional correctness: Data loads and displays as specified; user can submit and see feedback states; all UI states work as described.\n- Architecture: Clear use of standard React state/data management (hooks, props, context), with separation of concerns.\n- Reusability/maintainability: Modular, well-organized components.\n- User experience: Responsive, user-friendly feedback for all API async states.\n- Test coverage: Unit tests meaningfully reflect real-world usage and edge cases around data flows.\n\nLearning Outcomes Alignment\n\nYou will demonstrate:\n- The ability to architect and code React apps with robust, idiomatic data flow patterns.\n- Experience integrating and managing async real-world API data within React’s stateful paradigms, including error and loading states.\n- Proficiency in testing async logic and dynamic rendering in React using modern testing tools.\n\nThis scenario is explicitly tailored for intermediate web developers or learners who have mastered JavaScript fundamentals and wish to deepen their understanding of React’s data flow and external data integration. You will produce a feature-complete, industry-aligned dashboard with tested, high-quality code—mirroring practical EdTech challenges in the field."
