        "problem_statement": "Problem Statement: Predictive Maintenance Modeling for Industrial Equipment – A Manufacturing Analytics ML Pipeline\n\nScenario\n\nYou have just joined “SmartTech Manufacturing Solutions” as a Junior Data Analyst specializing in Manufacturing Analytics. The company operates a large production facility with hundreds of industrial machines, and unplanned downtime due to unexpected machine failures significantly impacts production efficiency and costs. The manufacturing management team has tasked you—with support from a Senior Data Scientist—to develop a predictive maintenance analytics pipeline to forecast potential machine failures before they occur.\n\nAs a Junior Data Analyst, your background includes basic Python programming, foundational data analysis, and introductory experience with machine learning concepts and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and xgboost. You have limited exposure to deploying full ML pipelines, but you are eager to enhance your skills by taking on a realistic, end-to-end project that simulates an industry-standard approach.\n\nProblem Context\n\nIn modern manufacturing, predictive maintenance leverages data from IoT sensors, machine logs, and historical failure records to forecast equipment breakdowns before they cause costly interruptions. You are supplied with a dataset containing historical sensor readings (e.g., vibration, temperature, pressure) and labeled failure events for a fleet of production machines.\n\nYour project involves building a fully-documented, modular ML pipeline. This includes setting up your Python project, ingesting and preprocessing raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, engineering relevant features, developing predictive models using scikit-learn and xgboost, evaluating and visualizing model performance, logging results, and making the entire architecture configurable and production-ready. You are expected to use best practices for code modularity, production logging, and error handling, and provide unit and integration tests with clear documentation.\n\nProject Objective\n\nThe objective is to design, implement, and document a robust and production-configurable machine learning pipeline for predictive maintenance in manufacturing, strictly using Python Data & ML tools (NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost) and staying within the provided project feature set. The pipeline must: \n- Load, clean, and preprocess raw sensor data from CSV files,\n- Conduct EDA and create compelling visualizations of relevant features, failure rates, and distributions,\n- Build and compare at least two predictive models (one using scikit-learn, one using xgboost),\n- Evaluate and visualize results using standard ML metrics,\n- Automate hyperparameter search with results logged to disk,\n- Provide all configurations via YAML/JSON, \n- Deliver a structure ready for deployment, testing, and further collaboration.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completing this project, you will have demonstrated the ability to:\n- Develop and test modular data pipelines for manufacturing analytics using standard Python tools,\n- Engineer features and apply/compare ML methods (scikit-learn, xgboost) on real-world-style manufacturing data,\n- Analyze, visualize, and interpret model outcomes, providing actionable recommendations for maintenance planning,\n- Configure, deploy, and thoroughly document an ML pipeline ready for real-world production environments, using comprehensive comments and documentation.\n\nTarget Audience & Assumptions\n\nThis project is designed for Junior Data Analysts and Early Career Data Scientists with:\n- Basic Python and command-line skills,\n- Familiarity with Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib,\n- Awareness of supervised machine learning and model evaluation concepts,\n- No prior experience required with advanced deployment or automation tools—only Python-standard practices, but with emphasis on writing modular, readable, testable, and maintainable code.\n\nTime Constraints\n\nThe fully modular pipeline should be implemented and tested in a 2-hour focused core coding session (core MVP), with additional learning and refinement (total project including testing, documentation, and extension not to exceed ~70 hours of study and practice). Milestones for the 2-hour session will be clearly defined in the technical instruction below.\n\nProject Technical Requirements & Deliverables\n\nYour task is to deliver a fully functional, modular, and documented machine learning analytics pipeline for predictive maintenance, strictly adhering to the following requirements:\n\n1. Project Directory Structure & Modular Code\n   - Use a standard production-style Python project layout (e.g., src/, data/, tests/, configs/, notebooks/, logs/, scripts/). All source code must be modular and reusable.\n\n2. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Pipeline\n   - Code modules to robustly load sensor data from CSV (via configurable path in YAML/JSON). Apply cleaning steps: handle missing values (e.g., impute/flag/drop), correct data types, convert time stamps, and scale features as needed. Output results to processed data files.\n\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis Visualizations\n   - Develop EDA scripts/notebooks to visualize distributions, relationships, class balance, feature importance, and time-based trends using matplotlib. EDA outputs (plots/charts) must be saved to disk.\n\n4. Predictive Model Creation (scikit-learn & xgboost)\n   - Implement at least two classifiers: one using scikit-learn (e.g., RandomForestClassifier or LogisticRegression), and one using xgboost (XGBClassifier). Encapsulate each in a modular pipeline for reuse.\n\n5. Model Evaluation Reports & Metrics Visualization\n   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Visualize results and save plots. Generate a written evaluation report (markdown or text file) summarizing findings.\n\n6. Hyperparameter Search & Results Logging\n   - Automate grid or random hyperparameter search for each model (using scikit-learn GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV or xgboost’s equivalents). Log parameter sets and scores to disk in a readable format (CSV or JSON).\n\n7. Configurable Pipeline (YAML/JSON)\n   - All paths, parameters, and model settings must be definable from external YAML or JSON config files, enabling easily reproducible runs.\n\n8. Comprehensive Code Comments & Documentation\n   - Provide clear comments in all modules explaining logic and design decisions. Include docstrings for all functions/classes.\n\n9. Setup, Build, Deployment & Test Scripts\n   - Scripted setup (e.g., requirements.txt and setup.sh or .bat), run and build scripts for each phase (data pipeline, train, evaluate, EDA), and deployment-style wrapper (main.py).\n\n10. Sample/Test Datasets\n    - Provide a (synthetic or anonymized) CSV data sample with sufficient records for testing pipelines. Ensure the data represents plausible sensor and failure-labeled information but does not include any private or real production data.\n\n11. Production-Style Logging & Error Handling\n    - Ensure all modules use Python logging to provide runtime information and capture errors/exceptions in log files.\n\n12. Unit & Integration Test Suites\n    - Write unit tests (e.g., pytest) for core pipeline modules (data processing, modeling). Provide basic integration tests for end-to-end pipeline validation.\n\n13. Detailed README with Setup and Usage Guides\n    - A comprehensive README.md describing:\n      - Project overview and objectives,\n      - Step-by-step setup/install instructions,\n      - Usage guide for running the entire pipeline (with config files),\n      - Explanation of the project structure and testing procedures,\n      - Example commands for each step,\n      - Descriptions of inputs/outputs and directory contents.\n\nStep-by-Step Breakdown (Core Project, 2-Hour MVP)\n\n0:00 – 0:15  |  Project Setup\n   - Scaffold directory structure and add initial README.md.\n   - Initialize git, add requirements.txt, place a sample dataset in /data/raw.\n\n0:15 – 0:35  |  Data Ingestion & Preprocessing\n   - Implement data_loader.py to load from CSV, configurable via configs/data_config.yaml.\n   - Implement preprocess.py to clean and scale data, with robust error handling/logging.\n   - Save processed data to /data/processed.\n\n0:35 – 0:55  |  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n   - Implement eda.py or a Jupyter notebook to produce and save basic EDA visualizations (distributions, correlations, time trends, class balance) in /notebooks or /eda.\n\n0:55 – 1:20  |  Predictive Model Development\n   - Implement model_scikit.py (e.g., RandomForest/LogisticRegression pipeline).\n   - Implement model_xgboost.py (XGBClassifier pipeline).\n   - Both must accept input data and parameters via YAML/JSON config.\n\n1:20 – 1:35  |  Model Evaluation & Visualization\n   - Implement evaluate.py for metrics calculation.\n   - Save evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC curves to /results.\n\n1:35 – 1:50  |  Hyperparameter Search & Logging\n   - Launch script for Config-driven hyperparameter search.\n   - Log search results and best parameters to /logs or /results.\n\n1:50 – 2:00  |  Testing & Documentation\n   - Write at least one unit test for each major component (pytest), store in /tests.\n   - Update README.md: include quickstart and high-level usage guide.\n\nSummary of Deliverables\n\n- Modular Python codebase, with robust directory structure;\n- Data ingestion, preprocessing, EDA, modeling, evaluation modules/scripts;\n- Scikit-learn and xgboost classifiers, hyperparameter search with logging;\n- Config files for full pipeline operation;\n- Logging, error handling, code comments, and docstrings;\n- End-to-end test datasets;\n- Unit/integration tests for core components;\n- Complete README with setup, run, and deployment guidance.\n\nAll instructions, scripts, and code must remain within the scope of Data Science & Machine Learning applied to the predictive maintenance domain in manufacturing, strictly using Python Data & ML tools: NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost. No external ML platforms, big data frameworks (e.g., Spark), or non-specified visualization/reporting tools.\n\nThis project will empower you to apply fundamental analytics, machine learning, and software engineering best practices to solve a real-world manufacturing challenge, preparing you for industrial-scale ML projects in your career."
