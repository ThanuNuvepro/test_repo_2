## Problem Statement
- Problem Statement: Predicting Equipment Failure in a Manufacturing Plant using Python Data & AI

Scenario: 

You are a Junior Data Analyst at UniFab Systems, a mid-sized manufacturer specializing in assembly-line production of automotive parts. The company relies heavily on the uptime of its equipment to meet tight deadlines and fulfill contracts. Recently, the production team has reported an increased number of unexpected machine failures, leading to costly downtimes and delivery delays. You have been assigned to the Advanced Analytics Team to develop an end-to-end predictive modeling solution that anticipates equipment breakdowns, enabling preventative maintenance scheduling.

Project Objective: 

Your goal is to use Python-based Data Science and Machine Learning (predictive modeling) techniques to analyze historical equipment sensor and maintenance log data. You will build a data pipeline that ingests raw manufacturing datasets (in CSV/Excel format), cleans and explores the data, visualizes operational trends, and develops robust predictive models to detect or predict equipment failure risk. The final deliverable is a reproducible, production-ready codebase with clear documentation, results reporting, and error handling, enabling your team to deploy and monitor this solution.

Specific Project Deliverables and Steps:

1. Automated Data Ingestion
   - Develop automated scripts to ingest manufacturing datasets (CSV/Excel): historical sensor readings, operational timestamps, and maintenance logs from multiple machines.
   - Use pandas to load data, implement checks for missing files and invalid formats, and log all data loading steps using logging library.
   - Provide configuration options (.env or .ini) for file paths and pipeline parameters.

2. Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Exploration
   - Systematically handle missing, invalid, or outlier sensor values.
   - Engineer relevant features (e.g., rolling averages, lag values, time since last maintenance).
   - Convert timestamps to usable durations or shift indicators.
   - Summarize and describe key variables, ensuring data types are appropriate for ML models.

3. Visualizations (matplotlib)
   - Generate and save the following for key variables:
     - Histograms (distribution of sensor readings and downtime intervals)
     - Scatter plots (e.g., temperature vs. vibration before failure)
     - Box plots (operational metrics across different equipment types or shifts)
   - All plots must have titles, axis labels, and clear legends. Save plots as PNG files.

4. Supervised Learning Models (scikit-learn)
   - Define the target variable: equipment failure (classification: failure/no failure in next 24h or regression: time-to-failure prediction).
   - Split data into training and test sets (ensure class balance where appropriate).
   - Build initial baseline models: LogisticRegression (for classification) or LinearRegression (for regression).
   - Provide cross-validation results and interpret key evaluation metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, RMSE, etc.).

5. Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Implement a grid/random search for optimizing model parameters for scikit-learn models.
   - Report the best-performing parameters and discuss effect on model performance.

6. Predictive Analytics Using XGBoost
   - Integrate XGBoost for advanced predictive modeling.
   - Train model, tune hyperparameters, and compare results with scikit-learn baseline.
   - Calculate feature importances and visualize key drivers of failure using matplotlib.

7. Comprehensive Result Reporting
   - Create concise summary reports containing:
     - Data quality assessment
     - Key visualizations and insights
     - Model performance metrics and confusion matrices
     - Interpretation of top predictive features
   - Output all plots and reports in a dedicated "results/" directory.

8. Testable, Modular Codebase and Documentation
   - Structure code into testable modules: ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, modeling, and reporting.
   - Extensively comment each function/class for clarity and learning.
   - Provide a README file explaining required dependencies, data structure, and execution steps.

9. Unit and Integration Testing
   - Implement unit tests (pytest) for key data processing and modeling functions.
   - Write at least one integration test for the entire pipeline (e.g., sample data -> prediction).

10. Reproducible Pipeline
    - Ensure that the entire project can be executed via a single CLI or script file (e.g., main.py or run_pipeline.sh), with all configurable parameters read from a config file.
    - All data splits, random seeds, and results must be fully reproducible.

11. Production-Readiness
    - Robust error handling for missing/corrupt data, modeling failures, and unexpected input.
    - Use clear logging for each pipeline step.
    - Provide basic deployment script (deploy.py) that allows a trained model to be applied to new incoming data (for predictive maintenance in production).

Learning Outcomes:

By completing this project, you will demonstrate the ability to:
- Master key Python ML and data analysis libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, logging, pytest)
- Develop, tune, and deploy predictive models on real-world manufacturing data, providing actionable business recommendations
- Apply best practices for project structuring, code documentation, and reproducibility in a collaborative industrial analytics environment
- Perform robust testing, results reporting, and error handling, supporting a production-grade analytics workflow

Target Audience Assumptions:

This project is designed for Junior Data Analysts in their first year of industry experience with basic Python proficiency and introductory exposure to pandas and scikit-learn. All technical concepts and scripts will be thoroughly explained and commented, with step-by-step instructions and code samples provided in the documentation. No prior manufacturing domain or advanced ML knowledge is assumed.

Time Constraints:

The entire end-to-end project is scoped for completion within approximately 2 hours of focused effort, assuming structured tasks and starter code/templates are available. Example allocations:
- Data ingestion and cleaning: 30 minutes
- Visualization and EDA: 15 minutes
- Baseline modeling: 20 minutes
- XGBoost and tuning: 15 minutes
- Reporting, testing, documentation: 30 minutes
- (All steps can be flexibly adjusted based on progress and available resources.)

Summary:

In your role as Junior Data Analyst, your challenge is to design, implement, and document a practical predictive analytics pipeline for manufacturing equipment failure, using only Python Data & AI tools and workflows. You will deliver not only a high-quality codebase but also interpretable insights and production-ready analytics artifacts that help drive preventative maintenance decisions and improve operational reliability. Strictly use only the defined feature set, and ensure that your solution meets industry standards for modularity, documentation, and testing. 

This hands-on project will help you build meaningful experience in Manufacturing Analytics, predictive modeling, and professional-grade ML application development—without overwhelming you with unnecessary complexity or off-topic concepts.
