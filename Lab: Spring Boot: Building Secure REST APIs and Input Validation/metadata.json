Your task is to design and implement the backend of an Educational Course Management System. The company has flagged secure user management and protecting sensitive student and instructor data as its top priorities, in response to recent industry regulations and increased risks of data breaches in the education sector.\n\nProject Objective\n\nYour mission is to develop a secure RESTful API using Spring Boot that supports core course management features for students and instructors. The API must allow user registration, authentication, and management of course resources (create, read, update, delete) with strict adherence to security best practices, robust input validation, and comprehensive documentation and testing. The solution should support multiple access levels (Admin, User), uphold data protection standards, and offer a seamless foundation for any future front-end or mobile development.\n\nAssumptions about Audience\n\nThis task is geared towards intermediate Java and Spring Boot developers who want to deepen their real-world experience with secure API development. The audience is assumed to have a working knowledge of Java, basic Spring Boot, REST concepts, and familiarity with JUnit and Swagger/OpenAPI.\n\nTime Constraints\n\nThe project is designed to be completed within 1 week (10-12 hours). A daily breakdown of milestones is provided.\n\nFeature Set Requirements\n\nYour deliverables must strictly adhere to the following core requirements:\n\n- User registration and login endpoints (Student/Instructor/Admin roles)\n- JWT-based authentication to secure API access\n- Role-based authorization (with “Admin” and “User” roles for managing access to resources)\n- Secure CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) endpoints for educational course resources (e.g., managing courses, enrollments)\n- Comprehensive input validation using standard and custom annotations\n- Centralized exception handling for validation and authentication errors\n- API documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI integration\n- Unit and integration tests emphasizing secure and validated endpoints\n\nLearning Outcomes Alignment\n\nBy the end of this project, you will:\n- Demonstrate the ability to architect and build secure REST APIs with Spring Boot in an education-specific scenario.\n- Gain mastery of Spring Security and JWT implementations for authentication and authorization.\n- Apply rigorous input validation strategies (including custom validators) to protect user and resource data.\n- Show confidence through well-documented APIs (Swagger/OpenAPI) and robust unit/integration test suites validating security and business rules.\n\nScenario Details and Project Milestones\n\nBackground: EduConnect’s existing platform is expanding. They plan to enroll thousands of new users in the coming months and will offer advanced admin dashboards. As the backend developer, you must ensure all new features (registration, login, course management) are secure against unauthorized data access, injection attacks, and input errors.\n\nProject Workflow (1 Week/10-12 hours):\n\nDay 1: Project Setup & Basic Entities (1.5 hours)\n\n- Initialize a new Spring Boot project with relevant dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, jjwt (JWT library), Validation, Swagger/OpenAPI, and testing dependencies.\n- Define JPA entities for User (with username/email, role, password hash), Course, and Enrollment.\n- Seed the database with an initial Admin user.\n\nDay 2: User Registration, Login, and Validation (2 hours)\n\n- Implement secure user registration endpoint (\"/api/auth/register\") requiring valid and unique usernames/emails with strong password requirements. Enforce using Bean Validation and custom annotations as needed (e.g., password strength, unique email).\n- Implement login endpoint (\"/api/auth/login\") to authenticate and return a JWT upon successful login.\n- All inputs must be robustly validated; invalid inputs return descriptive error messages.\n\nDay 3: JWT Authentication and Role-Based Authorization (2 hours)\n\n- Protect all secure API endpoints using JWT-based authentication; only authenticated users can access course management endpoints.\n- Implement role-based authorization: only “Admin” users can create, update, or delete courses; “User” (student/instructor) roles may only enroll in or view courses.\n- Ensure JWT is correctly parsed, user roles are validated in security context, and unauthorized access triggers standardized error responses.\n\nDay 4: Course Management Endpoints (CRUD) with Validation (2 hours)\n\n- Build endpoints for CRUD operations on Course resources:\n    - Create Course (POST /api/courses): Admin only.\n    - Get List of Courses (GET /api/courses): All authenticated users.\n    - Update Course (PUT /api/courses/{id}): Admin only.\n    - Delete Course (DELETE /api/courses/{id}): Admin only.\n- Integrate entity-level and field-level validation with both standard and custom validation annotations (e.g., non-empty titles, unique course codes, enrollment constraints).\n\nDay 5: Centralized Exception Handling (1.5 hours)\n\n- Implement a centralized exception handler (using @ControllerAdvice) for input validation failures and authentication/authorization errors.\n- All error responses must follow consistent JSON structure and provide actionable messages for client developers.\n\nDay 6: API Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI (1 hour)\n\n- Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI for full API documentation, including secure authentication flows and validation rules for each field.\n- Ensure that security schemes for JWT-based access are clearly described for front-end or third-party developers.\n\nDay 7: Unit/Integration Testing (2 hours)\n\n- Develop JUnit-based unit and integration tests for all secure endpoints, covering:\n    - Registration and login success/failure.\n    - Role-based access restrictions.\n    - Input validation (valid/invalid data for registration, course creation, etc.).\n    - Authentication and authorization failure scenarios.\n- Tests should use in-memory databases and mock JWTs where appropriate.\n\nSuccess Criteria\n\nYour project will be considered successful if:\n- All endpoints meet the security and validation requirements.\n- Only authorized users can access protected resources.\n- Invalid or malicious inputs are consistently rejected and handled gracefully.\n- The system is fully documented and has extensive test coverage of all critical paths.\n- The codebase is clean, modular, and ready for immediate integration with front-end teams.\n\nStrict Exclusions\n\nDo NOT include any features or code outside of:\n- Registration, login, JWT authentication, role-based authorization, secure course resource endpoints, input validation, standardized exception handling, API documentation, and endpoint testing.\nNo external integration, payment, analytics, or non-Education business logic.\n\nSummary Table of Deliverables\n\n| Deliverable                          | Feature/Outcome                            | Relevant Learning Outcome                  | Time Estimate |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Secure Registration/Login endpoints  | Secure onboarding, input validation        | Secure REST APIs, Input Validation         | 2h           |\n| JWT-based authentication & roles     | Secure API, Admin/User access              | Spring Security/JWT mastery                | 2h           |\n| CRUD Endpoints for Courses           | Secure, validated resource manipulation    | Secure REST APIs, Input Validation         | 2h           |\n| Centralized Exception Handling       | Robust error reporting                     | Input Validation, Secure REST APIs         | 1.5h         |\n| Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation        | API usability, validation documentation    | Documenting secure APIs                    | 1h           |\n| Unit/Integration Tests               | Proven security/validation enforcement     | Testing/documenting secure APIs            | 2h           |\n\nConcluding Reminder\n\nThis scenario mirrors authentic industry challenges faced by modern EdTech platforms. Your solution should maximize security, validation, and documentation using Spring Boot while demonstrating your ability to implement and rigorously test secure APIs. Focus exclusively on the outlined features and outcomes, and adhere closely to the provided milestones and structural guidelines."
