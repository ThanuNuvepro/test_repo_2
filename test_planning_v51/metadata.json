Your first assignment is to ensure that your development environment is set up correctly and that you have a basic understanding of running Python scripts. This is a foundational step before contributing to more complex projects, and your manager expects you to demonstrate the ability to write and execute a simple Python script as proof of readiness.\n\nProblem Context:\nIn the fast-paced tech industry, organizations often rely on small, foundational exercises to confirm that all team members are equipped to collaborate in a standardized environment. One of the industry’s best practices is to create a program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the screen. This universally recognized task is a sanity check for environment configuration, syntax familiarity, and serves as a learner’s rite of passage in programming teams.\n\nObjective:\nYour goal is to implement and execute a basic Python script that displays “Hello, World!” in the terminal/command prompt. This task will confirm that you can write syntactically correct Python code, understand the use of print statements, and are comfortable initiating and running Python-based projects – all essential for backend development with Python Core.\n\nProject Requirements:\n\n- Write a Python program that, when run, outputs exactly: Hello, World!\n- Ensure there are no additional characters, misspellings, or output discrepancies.\n- Execute the script successfully from the command line or integrated development environment (IDE).\n- Capture a screenshot of the successful output (optional, for submission to your manager).\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\n- Demonstrate the ability to write and execute a basic Python program.\n- Show familiarity with Python syntax, specifically the print statement.\n- Build confidence in starting Python-based projects in a backend development context.\n\nTarget Audience Alignment:\n\n- This project is designed for absolute beginners in backend development using Python.\n- No prior experience with Python or backend development is assumed, though general computer literacy and curiosity are expected.\n- Instructions are clear, unambiguous, and do not delve into topics beyond basic script creation and execution.\n\nTime Constraints:\n\n- The entire task is designed to be completed within 30 minutes.\n- Task breakdown:\n    - 10 minutes: Set up Python (install Python if necessary).\n    - 10 minutes: Write and save the script.\n    - 5 minutes: Run the script and verify output.\n    - 5 minutes: (Optional) Capture screenshot for documentation or manager submission.\n\nSummary of Deliverables:\n\n- Python script file named hello_world.py (or similar).\n- Console screenshot showing successful “Hello, World!” output (optional).\n\nStraightforward Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. Open your integrated development environment (IDE) or a simple text editor on your computer.\n2. In a new file, type the following line exactly:\n   ```python\n   print(\"Hello, World!\")\n   ```\n3. Save the file as hello_world.py on your desktop or a known directory.\n4. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n5. Navigate (cd) to the directory where you saved hello_world.py.\n6. Run the script by typing:\n   ```\n   python hello_world.py\n   ```\n7. Observe the output. The console should display:\n   ```\n   Hello, World!\n   ```\n8. If successful, (optional) take a screenshot for your records or to share with your manager.\n\nTeam-Based Instructions (Optional Extension)\n\nIf working in a group context (e.g., an onboarding bootcamp):\n\n- Assign one team member as the “Script Author” and another as the “Script Runner.”\n- The Script Author writes the hello_world.py file and shares it with the Script Runner.\n- The Script Runner follows the steps above to execute the script and verifies the output.\n- Team members discuss any issues encountered, building collaborative troubleshooting and support skills.\n\nEvaluation Criteria\n\n- The script executes without errors and outputs only “Hello, World!”.\n- The learner demonstrates correct use of Python print syntax.\n- The task is completed within the 30-minute window.\n- The learner expresses increased confidence in basic Python project execution.\n\nRelevance\n\nThis foundational exercise is a direct stepping stone in a backend developer’s journey with Python Core, establishing the confidence and technical proficiency required for all further backend application development.\n\nRemember: This project is about mastering the essential first step in Python backend development—writing and executing a script to display “Hello, World!”. No other features or advanced concepts are required or evaluated."
