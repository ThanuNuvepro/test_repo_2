## Problem Statement
- Problem Statement for Beginner Backend Developers in Python Core: “Hello World!” Application

Scenario-Based Problem Statement

Role:
You are a newly onboarded Junior Backend Developer at a global technology consultancy. Your first assignment is to ensure that your development environment is set up correctly and that you have a basic understanding of running Python scripts. This is a foundational step before contributing to more complex projects, and your manager expects you to demonstrate the ability to write and execute a simple Python script as proof of readiness.

Problem Context:
In the fast-paced tech industry, organizations often rely on small, foundational exercises to confirm that all team members are equipped to collaborate in a standardized environment. One of the industry’s best practices is to create a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. This universally recognized task is a sanity check for environment configuration, syntax familiarity, and serves as a learner’s rite of passage in programming teams.

Objective:
Your goal is to implement and execute a basic Python script that displays “Hello, World!” in the terminal/command prompt. This task will confirm that you can write syntactically correct Python code, understand the use of print statements, and are comfortable initiating and running Python-based projects – all essential for backend development with Python Core.

Project Requirements:

- Write a Python program that, when run, outputs exactly: Hello, World!
- Ensure there are no additional characters, misspellings, or output discrepancies.
- Execute the script successfully from the command line or integrated development environment (IDE).
- Capture a screenshot of the successful output (optional, for submission to your manager).

Learning Outcomes:

- Demonstrate the ability to write and execute a basic Python program.
- Show familiarity with Python syntax, specifically the print statement.
- Build confidence in starting Python-based projects in a backend development context.

Target Audience Alignment:

- This project is designed for absolute beginners in backend development using Python.
- No prior experience with Python or backend development is assumed, though general computer literacy and curiosity are expected.
- Instructions are clear, unambiguous, and do not delve into topics beyond basic script creation and execution.

Time Constraints:

- The entire task is designed to be completed within 30 minutes.
- Task breakdown:
    - 10 minutes: Set up Python (install Python if necessary).
    - 10 minutes: Write and save the script.
    - 5 minutes: Run the script and verify output.
    - 5 minutes: (Optional) Capture screenshot for documentation or manager submission.

Summary of Deliverables:

- Python script file named hello_world.py (or similar).
- Console screenshot showing successful “Hello, World!” output (optional).

Straightforward Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Open your integrated development environment (IDE) or a simple text editor on your computer.
2. In a new file, type the following line exactly:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
3. Save the file as hello_world.py on your desktop or a known directory.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate (cd) to the directory where you saved hello_world.py.
6. Run the script by typing:
   ```
   python hello_world.py
   ```
7. Observe the output. The console should display:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
8. If successful, (optional) take a screenshot for your records or to share with your manager.

Team-Based Instructions (Optional Extension)

If working in a group context (e.g., an onboarding bootcamp):

- Assign one team member as the “Script Author” and another as the “Script Runner.”
- The Script Author writes the hello_world.py file and shares it with the Script Runner.
- The Script Runner follows the steps above to execute the script and verifies the output.
- Team members discuss any issues encountered, building collaborative troubleshooting and support skills.

Evaluation Criteria

- The script executes without errors and outputs only “Hello, World!”.
- The learner demonstrates correct use of Python print syntax.
- The task is completed within the 30-minute window.
- The learner expresses increased confidence in basic Python project execution.

Relevance

This foundational exercise is a direct stepping stone in a backend developer’s journey with Python Core, establishing the confidence and technical proficiency required for all further backend application development.

Remember: This project is about mastering the essential first step in Python backend development—writing and executing a script to display “Hello, World!”. No other features or advanced concepts are required or evaluated.
