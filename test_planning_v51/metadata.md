## Problem Statement
- Scenario-Based Problem Statement

Project Title: Introduction to Python Scripting through General Purpose Application – The “Hello, World!” Task

Scenario:
You have recently joined the IT department of a mid-sized organization as a Junior Python Developer. The team is in the process of standardizing its onboarding process for all new hires, especially those unfamiliar with Python. As part of this initiative, you are tasked with creating a simple, standardized Python script that serves two key purposes: to verify that new developers can set up Python, write correct syntax, and execute scripts via the command line. This script will be incorporated into the company’s employee technical orientation checklist.

Problem Context:
In the rapidly evolving digital workplace, ensuring that all technical staff are comfortable using foundational programming tools is critical. Many organizations rely on small, standardized programs to validate that new employees have their development environments correctly configured and can perform basic scripting operations. Your company’s first test is to confirm that Python is properly installed and that a new hire can both write and execute a script.

Objective:
Your task is to create a well-formatted Python script named `hello_world.py` that, when executed from the command line, displays the message:

Hello, World!

in the console. The script should strictly adhere to industry standards for Python code formatting. You are also expected to run the Python script from the command line to verify correct execution.

Learning Outcomes Addressed:
- Ability to write a Python script: By constructing the script file from scratch using a text editor or IDE and saving it with the appropriate `.py` extension.
- Confident with basic Python syntax: By correctly writing the statement that displays “Hello, World!” to the console and following Python’s syntax conventions.
- Understand script execution: By running the script using the Python interpreter in the command-line environment and observing the output.

Assumptions About Target Audience:
- You are a beginner with limited or no prior experience with Python.
- You possess basic familiarity with computers, file systems, and typing text into a terminal or command prompt.
- No advanced programming concepts beyond Python’s core scripting fundamentals are expected in this task.

Time Constraint:
You should be able to complete this task within 10–15 minutes, including writing, saving, and executing the script, as well as performing a basic check for code formatting consistency.

Tasks and Instructions:

1. Open a text editor suitable for Python code (such as Notepad, VSCode, Sublime Text, or any IDE of your choice).
2. Write a single line Python script using the following statement to display “Hello, World!” in the console:
   
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
   
3. Ensure that your code follows basic code formatting standards:
   - The script should have no unnecessary comments or whitespace.
   - The file should start at line 1 (no blank lines before the code).
   - Save the file as `hello_world.py` in an easily accessible location (such as your Desktop or a dedicated coding folder).
4. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
5. Navigate to the directory containing your `hello_world.py` file using the `cd` (change directory) command.
6. Execute the script using the Python interpreter by typing:
   ```
   python hello_world.py
   ```
   Or, if your system defaults to Python 3 with a different command:
   ```
   python3 hello_world.py
   ```
7. Verify that the output displays exactly:
   
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
8. If the output does not match or errors are encountered, review your script for syntax correctness and try again.

Deliverables:
- A well-formatted Python source file named `hello_world.py` containing the specified code.
- Successful display of “Hello, World!” in the console upon execution from the command line.
- Confirmation that you understand the process of writing, saving, and running a Python script.

Relevance to General Purpose Application:
This foundational exercise introduces you to the core elements of using Python for general-purpose programming – setting up your workspace, understanding script file structure, mastering basic syntax, and running a program. These skills form the basis for any future software or automation work in Python, regardless of industry domain.

Evaluation Criteria:
- The script file must be correctly formatted, containing only the required code.
- The output in the terminal must precisely match “Hello, World!”
- The script must be executed from the command line, ensuring understanding of script execution.
- All steps should be completed within the assigned timeframe (10–15 minutes).

By completing this task, you will gain direct, hands-on experience with Python scripting fundamentals, instilling confidence in your ability to create and run simple, general-purpose programs—a critical first milestone in your programming journey.
