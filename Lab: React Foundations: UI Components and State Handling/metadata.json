Your current assignment is to design and implement a simple interactive dashboard that helps teachers monitor and manage their students' progress in class assignments. This dashboard should empower teachers to quickly view student lists, check assignment completion status, and mark assignments as completed through an engaging user interface built with React.\n\nCore Project Guidelines:\n\nReal-World Role:\nYou are acting as the frontend developer on a small team, responsible for building the foundational user interface components that teachers interact with daily. Your expertise in React will be applied to construct a real-life tool supporting classroom efficiency.\n\nProblem Context:\nModern teachers face the ongoing challenge of tracking multiple students’ assignment statuses in an ever-evolving educational landscape. Easy-to-use digital dashboards greatly reduce administrative overhead and allow teachers to focus on instructional needs. Your mission is to create a React-based solution that offers clear visibility and quick interactivity for assignment tracking, addressing genuine educator pain points.\n\nObjective:\nDevelop an interactive, stateful web dashboard using React, which:\n- Displays a list of students and their assignment completion statuses\n- Allows teachers to toggle (mark as completed/not completed) assignment statuses via the UI\n- Reflects all status changes immediately and updates the interface responsively\n- Segments the display to show students based on their completion status\n- Ensures components communicate via props, and the UI responds to user input events\n\nSpecific Requirements:\n1. User Interface: Create a visually clean, easy-to-understand dashboard listing students with assignment statuses.\n2. State Updates: Clicking an action button should update each student’s completion status using React state, instantly updating the display.\n3. Props Passing: Utilize parent and child components to manage and display student information, ensuring data and functions are passed correctly via props.\n4. Conditional Rendering & List Management: Render student rows dynamically from an array, with sections that conditionally display completed or incomplete students.\n5. Input Handling: Allow teachers to add a new student to the list via a simple form input, handling user input and dynamic list updates.\n\nLearning Outcomes Alignment:\nThis project is scoped to develop the following skills:\n- Ability to build and compose simple UI applications in React by breaking the dashboard into reusable components (e.g., StudentList, StudentRow, AddStudentForm)\n- Solid understanding of component-based UI architecture through the design and communication between parent (Dashboard) and child components\n- Confidence in managing the component data lifecycle (state and props) by tracking state in the parent, distributing data/functions via props, and updating UI upon events\n- Experience with essential React tooling and best practices, such as using functional components, hooks (useState), prop-types (if introduced), and clean code organization\n\nTarget Audience Alignment:\nThis challenge is tailored for beginner frontend developers and early-career software engineering learners who have basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript familiarity and are new to foundational React concepts. It assumes no prior experience beyond initial exposure to React component syntax and state management. All requirements and concepts are limited to React’s core principles, without advanced tooling or external libraries.\n\nTimeline and Time Constraints:\nThe project is designed to be completed in 2–4 focused hours. A suggested breakdown:\n- 30 minutes: Setup and scaffolding React project (using Create React App or Vite)\n- 30–45 minutes: Implementing the StudentList and StudentRow components, and mapping through student data\n- 30–45 minutes: Adding state and UI updates for completion status toggling\n- 30–45 minutes: Building and integrating AddStudentForm with input handling and dynamic state updates\n- Final 30 minutes: Testing UI interactions, refactoring for clarity and commenting code\n\nStep-by-Step Technical Instructions:\n1. Initial Setup:\n   - Create a new React project.\n   - Organize your folder with dedicated files for each component.\n\n2. Student Data Representation:\n   - In the Dashboard parent component, create a stateful array to store students (e.g., [{id: 1, name: \"Aaliyah\", completed: false}]).\n   - Prepopulate with 4–6 sample students.\n\n3. List & Row Components:\n   - Build a StudentList component to render a list of StudentRow components by mapping over the student array.\n   - Pass each student’s details and a function to toggle completion as props to StudentRow.\n\n4. State Updates on Interaction:\n   - In StudentRow, display the student name and a button to toggle their assignment status.\n   - When the button is clicked, call the toggle function. Update the state in the Dashboard so React rerenders the UI, visually reflecting the change.\n\n5. Conditional & List Rendering:\n   - In Dashboard or StudentList, use conditional rendering to create two sections: “Completed” and “Incomplete” students.\n   - Only display students in the appropriate section based on current state.\n\n6. Handling Basic User Input:\n   - Implement an AddStudentForm component with an input field and an “Add Student” button.\n   - On form submission, add the new student to the Dashboard’s array state and clear the input.\n   - Ensure the new student is rendered immediately.\n\n7. Props Communication:\n   - When a student’s completion status is toggled or a new student is added, ensure all changes propagate from the Dashboard state down to relevant child components via props.\n\n8. Best Practices:\n   - Use functional components and React hooks only (no class components).\n   - Organize props and state logically, adding comments for clarity.\n   - Maintain clean, readable code aligned with React community style guides.\n\nExpected Deliverables:\n- A working React app with the described dashboard, functional UI for toggling assignment status, clear separation of components, dynamic rendering, and user-driven state changes.\n- Well-commented, clean code that a beginner can understand and build upon.\n\nAssessment:\nUpon completion, you should demonstrate:\n- Confident breakdown of UI into React components and their logical relationships\n- Accurate use of state to manage application data and trigger rerenders\n- Ability to handle basic forms and user inputs for interactive UI changes\n- Proper passing of data and functions as props between parent and child components\n- Use of conditional and list rendering patterns to organize the UI based on data\n\nBy engaging in this project, you will gain practical experience with React foundations, empowering you with the skills and confidence to tackle more complex frontend applications in the education technology domain."
