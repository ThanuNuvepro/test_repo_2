1. Start the Spring Boot backend application:
   - In the terminal: run 'mvn spring-boot:run' or execute the Main class in your IDE.
2. Use Postman or curl to manually verify each endpoint:
   a) Create Student:
      curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/students         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d '{"name": "Test Student", "email": "test@student.com", "assignmentName": "Test Homework", "assignmentScore": 95.0}'
   b) Add or Update Assignment:
      curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/students/1/assignments         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d '{"name": "Updated Homework", "score": 88.0}'
   c) Get Student Summary:
      curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/students/1/summary
3. Observe and verify the responses returned:
   - Successful creation should return the new student object (HTTP 201).
   - Updating/adding an assignment should return the updated student data (HTTP 200).
   - The summary endpoint should return the student's name, assignmentCount, and averageScore (HTTP 200).
4. For invalid requests (missing fields, non-existent IDs), ensure proper error responses (400 or 404) are given.
5. Swagger UI documentation is accessible at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html (or /swagger-ui/index.html with SpringDoc).
6. Record all responses to ensure correct behavior and returned data structures in accordance with documentation.
