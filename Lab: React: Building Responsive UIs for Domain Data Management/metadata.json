        "problem_statement": "Problem Statement – Scenario-Driven: Domain Data Management Responsive UI with React\n\nYou are a Frontend Developer at \"DataCorp Solutions\", a company specializing in data management tools for medium-sized businesses. You have recently joined the product team tasked with revamping the Domain Management Dashboard, a web-based platform that allows clients to manage their company’s various domain data (e.g., registered web domains or internal business domains). Feedback from users highlights three major needs: a seamless experience on all devices, robust data management capabilities (including CRUD), and high usability regardless of network speed or device.\n\nProject Objective:\nDesign and implement a responsive, React-based Domain Management Dashboard that enables users to easily view, search, filter, and manage domain data. The dashboard must provide a stellar experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, empower users with intuitively designed CRUD operations, and handle real-time interactions with a remote API. Clear feedback — including loading states and error handling — must be present throughout the UI.\n\nIndustry Context:\nModern business workflows require real-time access and modification of domain records, often from the field or in meetings, via tablets and phones. Users expect enterprise-grade UIs: responsive layouts, interactive data visualizations (e.g., lists/tables or cards), modal dialogs for data input, input validation, useful feedback on actions (like errors or successes), and performant API-backed data flows.\n\nProject Requirements — Core Feature Delivery\n\nWithin 4-6 hours, you are to:\n\n1. Responsive Multi-Device Layout\n   - Implement a layout that adapts for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Use common breakpoints and responsive CSS/React strategies (e.g., CSS flexbox/grid, styled-components, or libraries like Material UI). The app must be fully functional and visually optimized on all target device sizes.\n\n2. Domain Data Listing, Searching, and Filtering\n   - Display all current domain records in a data-rich, interactive table or card layout.\n   - Implement real-time search and filter functions to help users locate specific domains efficiently.\n   - Ensure that these data views update instantly upon CRUD actions or in response to filter/search operations.\n\n3. CRUD Operations via UI\n   - Allow users to create new domain records, view individual details, update existing records, and delete unwanted entries.\n   - All actions must integrate with a REST API (either a mock service, like json-server, or a provided backend endpoint).\n   - The UI must optimistically reflect changes or revert them on failure, clearly indicating operation status via visual cues.\n\n4. Form Dialogs & Input Validation\n   - Use modal dialogs or slide-in panels for creating and editing domain records.\n   - Implement robust, real-time input validation (e.g., required fields, unique domain names, correct data formats). Provide immediate, accessible feedback on form errors to prevent invalid submissions.\n\n5. Data Visualization (Interactive Tables/Cards)\n   - Employ interactive tables or card-based layouts to showcase domain data. Columns or cards must allow basic sorting (e.g., by creation date or domain name).\n   - Use visual cues to highlight important statuses, like expiring domains or recently modified records.\n\n6. API Integration for Domain Data\n   - Build out frontend data fetching, updating, and error-handling logic, using React hooks and context or a simple state management solution (e.g., Redux Toolkit or React Context API) as appropriate.\n   - Demonstrate good practices in API data fetching (e.g., loading states, cancellation, minimal re-renders).\n\n7. User-Friendly Error States & Loading Indicators\n   - Clearly communicate all app states: show loading spinners, skeletons, or progress bars during data retrieval/CRUD operations.\n   - Display actionable, user-friendly error states for failed API requests or invalid user input, including advice for resolving issues (like retry or contact support).\n\nAssumptions About Your Background & Project Scope:\n- You are an intermediate React developer familiar with hooks, component abstraction, and common HTTP libraries (like axios or fetch).\n- You are practiced in basic state and effect management, simple component composition, and responsive CSS approaches.\n- The project will use mock data or a supplied API endpoint: no backend engineering is required.\n- Documentation, advanced theming/customization, and authentication are out of scope. Focus only on what’s specified above.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nBy completing this project, you will:\n- Master the creation of responsive UIs for domain data management using React, demonstrating the ability to build layouts that are adaptive and accessible on any device.\n- Deepen your skills in state management and API data flows in modern frontend apps, showing capability in managing local and remote state efficiently and transparently.\n- Solve common UI/UX problems using reusable, accessible React components, including error presentation, modals, and interactive tables/cards for data-centric applications.\n\nTimeline Guidance (Total: 4-6 Hours):\n\n- Hour 1: Scaffold the React app. Set up routing (if needed), layout structure, and demo data-fetching layer.\n- Hour 2: Develop the responsive layout and base navigation. Ensure main page(s) look good across device widths.\n- Hour 3: Build domain listing (table/card), search/filter, and connect to data source for real/fake API.\n- Hour 4: Implement CRUD actions, including modal dialogs or edit forms, and wire up input validation.\n- Hour 5: Integrate error handling, loading indicators, and polish UX for all user flows.\n- Hour 6: Final review; ensure all requirements are met, code is organized, and the UI/UX is cohesive across mobile/tablet/desktop.\n\nDeliverables:\n- A working, responsive React application for comprehensive domain data management as described.\n- All must-have features implemented as outlined.\n- Codebase and documentation (as comments or README) clear enough for a peer to understand the app’s structure and flow.\n\nBy completing this project, you’ll deliver a portfolio-ready, intermediate-level data management dashboard for real-world use—demonstrating mastery of responsive React UIs and best-practice frontend workflows for interactive, data-centric applications."
