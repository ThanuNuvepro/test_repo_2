        "problem_statement": "Scenario-Based Problem Statement for Beginner PostgreSQL Developers: Student Course Management System\n\nScenario Description:\nYou are a Junior Database Developer at an EdTech startup that is building a platform for managing students, courses, and enrollments in coding bootcamps. The engineering team is in the early stages of system development and needs an efficient relational database schema for the core data. As someone new to PostgreSQL, you are tasked with setting up the foundation for this system using PostgreSQL essentials.\n\nYour supervisor expects you to deliver a fully functioning schema with practical demonstrations of fundamental database concepts. Your contribution will serve as a base for future application developers and data analysts in the company.\n\nProject Objective:\nDesign and implement the initial PostgreSQL database for the Student Course Management System, covering essential database management skills. This project includes: installing PostgreSQL, creating a normalized schema, demonstrating various data types, enforcing constraints for data integrity, inserting representative sample records, and crafting SELECT queries that verify your design.\n\nProject Details & Requirements:\n\n1. PostgreSQL Installation Steps (30 minutes)\n   - Download and install the latest stable version of PostgreSQL on your development machine.\n   - Document each step taken, including initializing a database cluster and accessing the PostgreSQL prompt.\n   - Create a new database student_course_db dedicated to this project.\n\n2. Schema and Table Creation Scripts (30 minutes)\n   - Design the schema to represent the following entities:\n     - Students (basic personal info)\n     - Courses (offered by the platform)\n     - Enrollments (which students enroll in which courses)\n   - Write PostgreSQL SQL scripts to create the following tables:\n     - students\n     - courses\n     - enrollments\n   - Ensure your scripts are clean, formatted, and ready to execute in psql or any PostgreSQL client.\n\n3. Data Types Demonstration (15 minutes)\n   - Appropriately select native PostgreSQL data types for each column according to the data stored (e.g., VARCHAR, INTEGER, DATE, BOOLEAN).\n   - Include at least one example of a numeric, character, date, and boolean type across your tables.\n   - Comment your CREATE TABLE scripts to explain your data type choices.\n\n4. Defining and Enforcing Constraints (15 minutes)\n   - In your CREATE TABLE statements, apply the following constraints:\n     - Primary keys for each table (e.g., student_id, course_id, enrollment_id)\n     - Foreign key constraints in enrollments to reference students and courses\n     - NOT NULL on fields that must always contain values (e.g., student names, course titles)\n     - UNIQUE constraint on student email in the students table\n     - CHECK constraint on course credits column (e.g., credits must be between 1 and 10)\n   - Comment on each constraint to clarify its purpose.\n\n5. Sample Data Insertion (15 minutes)\n   - Provide INSERT INTO scripts that add at least:\n     - Three students (varying personal data)\n     - Two courses (distinct course properties)\n     - Four enrollments (ensuring at least one student is enrolled in multiple courses and one course has multiple students)\n   - Ensure all constraints are respected in your sample data.\n\n6. Sample SELECT Queries Verifying Schema (15 minutes)\n   - Write SELECT statements that:\n     - Retrieve all students and their enrolled courses (using JOINs)\n     - List all courses with the number of students enrolled in each\n     - Verify that constraints work (e.g., attempt to insert an invalid record, comment on the expected failure)\n   - Document the output/expected results for each query.\n\nDeliverables:\n- A single SQL file (or set of files) with:\n  - All CREATE TABLE statements\n  - Inline comments explaining schema choices, data types, and constraints\n  - All sample INSERT INTO statements\n  - All SELECT queries as described\n- A brief install-and-execution guide summarizing how to set up PostgreSQL and run your scripts from scratch.\n\nLearning Outcomes Alignment:\n- You will demonstrate understanding of basic relational database design, normalization, and entity relationships.\n- You will gain hands-on experience with PostgreSQL installation and command-line utilities.\n- You will learn how to define schemas, select appropriate data types, and enforce real-world data integrity constraints.\n- You will practice data insertion and querying basics with sample business-like data.\n\nTarget Audience & Assumptions:\n- This project is tailored for beginner developers and students with little to no prior exposure to PostgreSQL or relational databases.\n- Assumes familiarity with fundamental programming concepts but limited SQL experience.\n- All tasks and expectations are appropriate for a 2–3 hour beginner hands-on learning session.\n\nTime Constraints:\n- PostgreSQL installation and initial setup: 30 minutes\n- Schema, data types, and constraint scripting: 1 hour\n- Sample data entry and query writing: 30 minutes\n- Documentation and submission: 30 minutes\n\nSummary:\nYou are to set up a core student-course-enrollment schema in PostgreSQL, fully documenting your reasoning. You will apply and demonstrate key PostgreSQL features through scripts and queries that model actual developer education data and workflows. No steps go beyond essential schema setup or conceptual boundaries. This practical assignment will equip you with foundational PostgreSQL and database design skills directly applicable to developer education and system initialization.\n\nCompletion within the 2–3 hour timeframe will provide a solid introduction to PostgreSQL’s essentials, preparing you for more advanced database development scenarios."
