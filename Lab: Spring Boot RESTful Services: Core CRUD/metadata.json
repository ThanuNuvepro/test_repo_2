        "problem_statement": "Scenario-Based Project Problem Statement (Education Domain): Student Management RESTful API with Spring Boot\n\nRole & Industry Context:\nYou are a junior backend developer at EduSprint, a growing EdTech company dedicated to streamlining administrative operations for K-12 schools. Your team has been tasked with developing a new microservice to manage student information for the district’s student portal. The current process is manual and error-prone, making it hard for teachers and administrators to quickly access or update student records.\n\nProject Objective:\nYour goal is to design and implement a RESTful backend service for managing student profiles using Spring Boot. The service must allow teachers and administrative staff to create, read, update, and delete student records through a secure, well-documented, and robust API. The system must persist student data in a relational database, provide appropriate feedback and error handling, and include a thorough test suite to ensure reliability.\n\nTarget Audience:\nThe project is designed for beginner to intermediate Java backend developers, CS students, or educators looking to gain practical skills in developing REST APIs with Spring Boot. It assumes familiarity with basic Java and OOP concepts, and some introductory exposure to Maven, IDEs, and relational databases (e.g., MySQL, H2).\n\nProject Features and Deliverables:\n\n1. Entity & Model Design\n- Define a Student Java class annotated as a JPA Entity with fields: id (auto-generated Long), firstName (String), lastName (String), email (String, must be unique/valid), and enrollmentDate (LocalDate).\n- Use Javax validation annotations to enforce: non-blank names, valid/unique emails, and past/enrollmentDate checks.\n\n2. Spring Boot Project Initialization\n- Create a new Maven-based Spring Boot project.\n- Add necessary dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database (for development/demo), Validation, and Swagger.\n\n3. CRUD REST API Development\n- Implement a RESTful controller to expose endpoints:\n  - POST /students — Create a new student record.\n  - GET /students — Retrieve a list of all students.\n  - GET /students/{id} — Retrieve a specific student by ID.\n  - PUT /students/{id} — Update details of an existing student.\n  - DELETE /students/{id} — Remove a student profile.\n- All endpoints must conform to RESTful standards, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.\n\n4. Persistence Layer Integration\n- Use Spring Data JPA to interact with the database.\n- Create a StudentRepository interface extending JpaRepository.\n- Configure the application to use an in-memory H2 database for simplicity.\n\n5. Exception Handling & Error Responses\n- Implement global exception handling (e.g., via @ControllerAdvice).\n- Return meaningful JSON error responses for cases like record not found, invalid input, and duplicate emails.\n- Ensure that API consumers receive clear messages and consistent error formats.\n\n6. Input Validation\n- Leverage Javax validation (@NotBlank, @Email, @Past, etc.) with meaningful messages.\n- Invalid inputs should result in standardized error responses with status 400.\n\n7. API Documentation\n- Integrate Swagger UI (OpenAPI) to auto-generate interactive API documentation.\n- Ensure that API consumers can view and try out all endpoints from an in-browser UI.\n\n8. Testing\n- Write unit tests for the controller (using MockMvc for HTTP interactions).\n- Write integration tests for the repository to verify JPA functionality.\n- Ensure coverage of both success and error cases (e.g., invalid data, resource not found).\n\nTimeline & Milestones (3-4 Hours Total):\n\n- Hour 1: Project setup, entity/model design, JPA repository implementation.\n- Hour 2: Develop RESTful controller with CRUD endpoints and input validation.\n- Hour 3: Implement exception handling, integrate Swagger UI, and prepare API documentation.\n- Hour 4: Write and execute unit/integration tests; final verification and demo using Swagger UI.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nUpon completing this project, you will be able to:\n\n- Build a fully functional Spring Boot RESTful API for educational use-cases, gaining hands-on experience with real-world backend development.\n- Apply and demonstrate CRUD principles for backend data management using industry-standard REST conventions.\n- Master the use of Spring Data JPA to persist, query, and manage data in a relational database context.\n- Design robust, user-friendly APIs with comprehensive validation and custom error handling for enhanced reliability and usability.\n- Effectively document APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI, facilitating quick onboarding and confidence for frontend or integration developers.\n- Achieve proficiency in unit and integration testing for backend services, ensuring quality and maintainability.\n\nTask Summary (Strictly Within Defined Features):\n\n1. Create a Spring Boot project for the Student entity.\n2. Expose REST endpoints supporting CRUD operations for students.\n3. Persist and query student data with Spring Data JPA (H2 for development).\n4. Implement input validation (Javax annotations) and handle errors gracefully.\n5. Provide comprehensive API docs via Swagger UI.\n6. Deliver robust unit/integration tests for all controller and repository logic.\n\nAssumptions & Constraints:\n\n- No frontend/UI implementation is required; all interaction is via REST API/Swagger UI.\n- Stick to the specified feature set and learning outcomes—no advanced security/authentication, microservices, or unrelated Spring components.\n\nPractical Application in Education:\n\nBy completing this project, you contribute a foundational microservice for managing student records. The skills and patterns established here are directly transferable to broader education technology initiatives, including course management, attendance tracking, and report generation—building blocks of modern EdTech infrastructure.\n\nYour deliverable will serve as a base for hands-on classroom labs, coding bootcamps, or jumpstart kits for new Java backend developers in the education sector.\n\nGet started by scaffolding your project, modeling your entity, and building out the API—aim for rigor, clarity, and completeness!"
